Predictive failure prevention in motors is critical to maintaining operational efficiency and reducing downtime in pulp mill operations, where reliability and
continuous operation are paramount. Electric motors, used extensively in thevarious mechanical processes of pulp mills such as wood chipping, pulping, and
paper production, are prone to failure due to factors like mechanical wear, electrical faults, thermal stress, and environmental conditions. Early detection anddiagnosis
of potential motor failures can prevent unscheduled shutdowns, minimize maintenance costs, and extend equipment life. This project presents a predictive 
maintenance strategy focused on motor failure prevention, leveraging condition monitoring techniques, data analytics, and machine learning algorithms.Vibration
analysis, temperature monitoring, current signature analysis, and acoustic emission sensors are integrated to collect real-time data on motor health. The data is then
processed using advanced algorithms, through Arduini UNO, to identify failure patterns and predict motor malfunction before it occurs. A case study from a realworld 
pulp mill operation is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the predictive maintenance system. The study shows how continuous monitoring,
combinedwith predictive analytics, can accurately forecast potential motor failures, reducing unplanned downtime and enhancing system reliability. Furthermore, the
project discusses the integration of predictive maintenance with existing mill management systems, enabling seamless data sharing and real-time decisionmaking.
